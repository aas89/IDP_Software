// following the white line
// requires input from photodiode sensor

// may need two seperate functions for following each side of the line.
// for example it needs to follow the right side of the line to come out of the tunnel and drop off victims
// alternatively just always follow right side.

// function follow_line_left()
// function follow_line_right()
